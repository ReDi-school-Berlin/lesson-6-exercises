#  ----------------------------
# Print every integer number until 10 starting from 1 using a for loop and the range() function
# i = 1 
# while i <= 10:
#     print(i) 
#     i += 1

# for i in range(11):
#     print(i)





# ----------------
# Using the same loop above, stop printing when it's 5
for i in range(11):
    print(i)
    if i == 5:
        break
