# Print every integer number until 10 starting from 1 using a while loop
# i = 1 
# while i <= 10:
#     print(i) 
#     i += 1




# ----------------
# Using the same loop above, stop printing when it's 5
# i = 1 
# while i <= 5:
#     print(i) 
#     i += 1


i = 1 
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    if i == 5:
        break
     
    i += 1
